# CISC_3130_Data_Structures_Course
 Hi and welcome to CISC 3130 a Course in Data Structures. The course will be taught in Java but if you learned or are familiar with a different language you can code the Homework's in that language as well. My name is Professor Lowenthal and I am a professor in the CIS Department.

 

When you finish this course, you will have accumulated knowledge of assorted data structures such as Stacks, Queues, Lists and Trees as well as have a working understanding of how Sorting and Searching are instrumental to becoming expert and efficient programmers. (I will post in blackboard the detail Syllabus as well as the Course Schedule before the 1st class along with at least the first HW assignment for the semester.) 

We will learn the pros and cons of choosing which structures and/or which sorts to use in different applications. Together we can grow and make ourselves more efficient and knowledgeable   developers of software.

An interesting item about this course is even though we are teaching it in Java these Data Structures and Sort/Search algorithms actually apply to almost any language you will code in when you get your first (and subsequent) job(s) in this field.
